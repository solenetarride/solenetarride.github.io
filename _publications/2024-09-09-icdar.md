## Abstract
PyLaia is one of the most popular open-source software for Automatic Text Recognition (ATR), delivering strong performance in terms of speed and accuracy. In this paper, we outline our recent contributions to the PyLaia library, focusing on the incorporation of reliable confidence scores and the integration of statistical language modeling during decoding. Our implementation provides an easy way to combine PyLaia with n-grams language models at different levels. One of the highlights of this work is that language models are completely auto-tuned: they can be built and used easily without any expert knowledge, and without requiring any additional data. To demonstrate the significance of our contribution, we evaluate PyLaiaâ€™s performance on twelve datasets, both with and without language modelling. The results show that decoding with small language models improves the Word Error Rate by 13% and the Character Error Rate by 12% in average. Additionally, we conduct an analysis of confidence scores and highlight the importance of calibration techniques. Our implementation is publicly available in the official PyLaia repository (https://gitlab.teklia.com/atr/pylaia), and twelve open-source models are released on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/collections/Teklia/pylaia-65f16e9ae0aa03690e9e9f80).
