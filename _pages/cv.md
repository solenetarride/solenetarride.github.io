## Work experience

* **Since Feb 2022: AI Researcher, [Teklia](https://teklia.com/)** (Paris, France)
  * Contributing to research projects focused on automatic information extraction from handwritten and printed historical documents. Areas of expertise include:
     * Automatic information extraction 
     * Model adaptation strategies
     * Unsupervised quality estimation
     * Integration of language constraints
     * Design of evaluation protocols
  * Key projects:
     * [**Finlam (ANR project)**](https://projets.litislab.fr/finlam/). Multimodal models for libraries, archives, and museums, with a focus on automatic article extraction from historical digitized newspapers. Collaboration with LITIS (project lead) and the National Library of France.
     * [**DAI-CReTDHI (ANR project)**](https://dai-cretdhi.univ-lr.fr/). Automatic information extraction from 16th–18th century population registers to support historical demography and family social history research. Collaboration with L3I (project lead), INED, Sorbonne University, CETHIS, and Geneanet. 
    * [**Socface (ANR project)**](https://socface.site.ined.fr/) : Automated information extraction from French census records (1836–1936) to study the evolution of French society over a century. Collaboration with INED (project lead), Paris School of Economics, and France Archives.
    * [**Hugin Munin**](https://hugin-munin-project.github.io/) :  AI-driven handwriting recognition to enhance access to Norwegian cultural heritage. Collaboration with Østfold University College (project lead), the National Library of Norway, and Anahit.
     * [**i-BALSAC**](https://balsac.uqac.ca/) :  Information extraction from historical Quebec population records to study francophone migration patterns in North America. Collaboration with the University of Quebec at Chicoutimi (project lead).
* **Feb. 2019 - Jan. 2022: Ph.D. student, [Doptim](http://doptim.eu/) & [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/en), (Rennes, France)**
  * Developed deep learning methods for the extraction of genealogical information from French historical registers
  * Scientific communication (peer-reviewed papers, conference presentations)
  * Teaching assistant for Master’s-level students (Agile methodology and software development)
* **Oct. 2018 - Jan. 2019: Research Engineer, [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/en), (Rennes, France)**
  * Worked on automatic understanding and processing of administrative forms (CERFA documents)
* **Apr. 2018 - Sept. 2018 : Research intern, [Université de Rennes](https://www.univ-rennes.fr/), (Rennes, France)**
  * Applied deep learning for automatic segmentation of multiple sclerosis lesions in MRI images
