Welcome to my academic page! 

I am a research engineer at [TEKLIA](https://teklia.com/) where I develop new method for handwriting recognition on historical and modern documents. I work remotely from Nantes.

My research interests include computer vision, handwritten text recognition, natural language processing, attention-based neural networks.

I received a M.Eng. degree in Computer Science from [ENSIIE](https://www.ensiie.fr/) and a M.Sc. degree in Data Science from [Universit√© Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/electronique-energie-electrique-automatique/m2-traitement-de-linformation-et-exploitation-donnees). 
I also hold a Ph.D in Computer Science from [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/). During my thesis with [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/) and [Doptim](https://doptim.eu/), I focused on Deep Learning for historical document understanding.
