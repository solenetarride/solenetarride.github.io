Welcome to my academic page! 

I am a researcher at [TEKLIA](https://teklia.com/) where I develop new methods for **Automatic Document Understanding**. 
I work remotely from Nantes.

My research interests include:
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Automatic text recognition (printed or handwritten)
- Named entity recogntion and linking
- Image and text classification/clustering
- (Grounding) object detection
- Visual question answering
- Image captionning
