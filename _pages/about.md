Welcome to my academic page! 

I am a researcher at [TEKLIA](https://teklia.com/) where I develop new methods for **Automatic Document Understanding**. 
I work remotely from Nantes.

My research interests include computer vision, handwritten text recognition, natural language processing, visual question answering and image captionning.

What's new?
