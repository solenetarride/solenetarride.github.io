Welcome to my academic page! 

I am a researcher at [TEKLIA](https://teklia.com/) where I develop new methods for **Automatic Document Understanding**. 
I work remotely from Nantes.

My research interests include:
- Computer vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Automatic Text Recognition (printed or handwritten)
- Image and text classification
- Object detection
- Visual question answering
- Image captionning
